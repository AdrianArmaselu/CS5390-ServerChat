1. Do we have to send communication EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED IN THE SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT?
2. Do we need to send the ip address ourselves, or do we just need to send the register historyMessage
3. If you are already in a chat, do you do start chat directly or have to close the chat first?
4. if a new datagram socket is created, it will not be listening on a new port


Issues I found:
1. I needed to find a way to better communicate through UDP because just having a large buffer did not cut it
2. I needed to find  a way to design and separate components to make modifications and find errors easily
3. had issues with transmitting historyMessage: string vs byte array when encrypting
4. If two users connect via tcp at the same time, how to differentiate?
Added functionality to send large messages by splitting the message into multiple packets
